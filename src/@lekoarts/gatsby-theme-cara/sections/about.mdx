## About

In a nuteshell, I am a programmer and help teams solve human problems with technology. I specialize in building software for clients ranging from individuals and small-businesses all the way to large enterprise corporations and governments.

Over the past ten years, I have done work in software development, mobile app creation, front-end/back-end web, and database/server management.
